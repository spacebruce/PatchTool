# PatchTool
Simple IPS and BPS file patcher for Windows. Has untested and most likely broken UPS file support.

Intended for my personal use, has a good chance of producing mangled files.

Usage;
>PatchTool.exe rompath patchpath output

Paths can be local (romname.smc) or absolute (c:\whatever\romname.smc)
